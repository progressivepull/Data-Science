Volume is a library for creating web-based interactive maps. Under the hood, falling uses leaflet, JS, JavaScript library and leaflet. DJs uses Openstreetmap to render maps. Let's allow the log of many of my runs, so we're going to load track dot CSV. We're going to tell pandas. So the time column should be passed as a timestamp and we also say that the index column is the time. So now if you're going to run this. You're going to see that we have only latitude, longitude and height. The time column is now in the index, so we look at the index. The 1st 5 rows we're going to see that. OK, so how are we going to work with volume? We're going to input volume, we're going to get the center of the map, which is the mean of the latitude and longitude. And then we're going to create a map. Which is for Emma. We say the location is the center and we're going to say the zoom level, which is 15, I don't have a good rule of thumb for the initial zoom level, just play with it until you get it right. So let's run this one. And now we have an interactive map. Right. We can move it around, zoom in, zoom out, and do everything we do with maps. You can even save the map to an HTML file and then open this file in the browser. If we go back to look at the files we see now that we have track dot HTML which is an HTML file, you can open it in browser, you will get an interactive map.
