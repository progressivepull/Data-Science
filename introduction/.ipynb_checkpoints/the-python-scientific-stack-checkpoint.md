# The Python Scientific Stack

Data science is booming, and Python is a major layer. Hi, together we'll crunch some data, train some models. Create visualizations and generally have fun with Python and data. We'll solve many exercises while learning. I highly recommend that you follow along and write code. From my experience, there's some magic happening between the fingers and the brain that correctly improves the learning process. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Python is a very forgiving language and recovering from errors. During this course, we'll cover tools and techniques that I find useful in my daily work, processing data, and gaining insights from it. I hope you'll find these tools and techniques beneficial as well.
