Let's load the data from the CSV. You need to either run the download CSV or copy over taxi CSV from one of the other chapters. So let's start import pandas D and we're going to use PD read CSV to load the file and finally we're going to print out the length, adding 1000 comma separator. For the number of rows, let's run the cell. And you see we have 1000 row. Let's have a look at the first one by using the iloc accessor for row #0. So run the cell and we're going to see we have a vendor ID, we have the pickup and drop off time. How many passenger trip distance and many other attributes. Let's look at the data types. So I'm calling DFD types and this is going to show me the data type per column. We see that the vendor ID is an integer, but the pickup and dropoff are objects, which means strings. Let's fix that. We know the time, so we define the time columns as the pickup and the dropoff, and now we use the read CSV and tell pandas to pass dates in these time columns. And now we can look at the data type again. Now we see that both the pickup time and the drop off time are daytime as we want. Them. A lot of time you will get data which is a bit messy and not formatted properly. This is why it's important to have a look at the data and see that what you load looks OK before doing any more work.
