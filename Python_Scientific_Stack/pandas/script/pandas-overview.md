## CH3/03_01 Pandas Overview   

Data in the real world is often composed from values that have mixed types. Some can be numeric age, for example, some can be textual names, for example, some can be time like the year of birth, et cetera, et cetera. 

Pandas is a library built for real world data data that is messy, incomplete and from various types. Once Pandas was released, it was adopted by the scientific community as the tool for dealing with data. 

Pandas also excels with working with time series data. You can easily select subsets of data by time and also change the frequency of the events to suit your needs. 

You can think of pandas as providing in memory Excel data sheet. Which we call data frame with many many extra features. Pandas data frame can process large amount of data. I've personally worked with millions of rows and it can draw charts, join other data frames, pivot tables and more. 

Apart from being very useful, pandas is one of the best documented projects out there. The documentation contains many, many code examples. 

It is also worth reading the book Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition which was written by Wes McKinney.
