So here is my solution. First, we're going to load the data frame, pass the dates, the index call, and then resample to a minute frequency. Next, we're going to create the map, so importing volume and then creating a map with the location at the mean and the zoom start is 15 and now the add marker function. So getting the location from the latitude and long. Creating a circle marker at that location with Radius 5 and now the color it is blue if the height is less than 100, otherwise it's. To be read and we're going to add a pop up for the time. Finally we add the marker to the map and then we call the data frame apply method on add marker with access equal 1 meaning work on every row and display the map. And now we can see the track. Most of the dots are below 100 meters. The beginning is a bit higher, so the points are red.
