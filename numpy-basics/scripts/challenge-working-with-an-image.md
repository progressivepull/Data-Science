## Challenge

Say we have this image of a flower. We can use Matplotlib to load this image into memory. 

So we use the **imread method**, we create a copy to make it readable and then I'm going to use **plt to show it**. If you're going to run the cell. You're going to see the flower image. If you look at the type of the image you're going to see that it's a Numpy Array. 

And when we look at the shape of the array we see it's 1200 by 900. These are the **number of pixels so 1200 on 900, values three for the color red, green and blue**. 

What I want you to do is draw a Blue Square around the flower.

The **top left should be at 190 on 350**. The **bottom right should be on 680 and 850** and the **line width should be 5**.
