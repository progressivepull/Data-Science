Let's have a look at my solution. First. We're going to run the code, so we're going to load the image. And we're going to print the type and the shape. Now we're going to look at our code. Let me hide the left side. So we define the top left X and the top left Y and the bottom right X and the bottom right Y and the width. Also, the color which is blue, right, we have RGB, red, green, blue, red and green are zero and blue is full and now we draw the lines using slicing. So from the top left to the top left plus width up to the top left, Y to the bottom right Y equal color. This is the top line. Then the bottom line. Which is bottom right ticks the bottom right ticks plus width top left, Y, bottom right Y. And then we're doing the vertical lines, so top left X to bottom right, X top left, Y the top left, Y plus the width, and then finally the right line top left X to bottom right X button right to Y minus width to bottom right Y and then we are going to show the. Image. So let's call it up and run this cell. And now we see the picture and we have a square around the flow.
