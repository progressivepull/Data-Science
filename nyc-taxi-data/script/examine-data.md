We're going to look at some data about taxi rides published by the New York City. Before you can start, you need to run the download data script in the video folder. This will download the text CSV file. It might take a little bit so I suggest that you'll keep this file around and copy it over from charter. Charter. Let's see if we can safely load this data into memory so from pathlib input path we create the CSV file, define what is a MB and then use the start method of the file to get the size which is in bytes and divide it by a MB. Let's run this and it's about 163 megabytes. It is safe to load into memory. Next we're going to have a look at few of the initial lines and see how many lines there are in to. Initialize the number of lines, open the file and use enumerate. If the line is one of the 1st 5 lines, I'm going to print it out and always increment the counter. Finally print out the number of lines. And we're going to run this one. You're going to see we have the vendor ID. The pick up. And drop off time. How many passenger in the passenger account the distance and many more attributes and we have about a million lines.
